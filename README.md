## 🎯 **MISSION OBJECTIVES**

Build a complete, automated, and secure Logstash deployment using advanced Terraform modularity and Ansible automation, demonstrating mastery of Infrastructure as Code evolution and enterprise-grade modular architecture.

## 🏗️ **ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW**

This repository implements a **modular Terraform architecture** with **Ansible automation** for secure Logstash deployment:

```
Architecture Components:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  🌐 VPC + Public/Private Subnets       │
│  🖥️  Bastion Host (Public Subnet)       │
│  📊 Logstash Instance (Private Subnet)  │
│  🔒 Security Groups (Defense in Depth)  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```
