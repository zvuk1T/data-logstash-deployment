# Compute Module

## Overview

The compute module creates EC2 instances and security groups for a secure Logstash deployment using a bastion host architecture. This module implements defense-in-depth security principles with network isolation and controlled access patterns.

## Architecture

```
Internet Gateway
       â”‚
   Public Subnet (10.0.1.0/24)
       â”‚
   Bastion Host (SSH Gateway)
       â”‚
   Private Subnet (10.0.2.0/24)
       â”‚
   Logstash Instance (Isolated)
```

### Security Design

- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimal required access only
- **Network Isolation**: Private subnet with no direct internet access
- **Single Point of Entry**: Bastion host as controlled gateway

## Resources Created

### Security Groups

1. **Bastion Security Group**
   - Inbound: SSH (port 22) from `allowed_ssh_cidr`
   - Outbound: All traffic (for maintenance and updates)
   - Purpose: Internet-facing SSH gateway

2. **Logstash Security Group**
   - Inbound: SSH (port 22) from bastion security group only
   - Inbound: Logstash port (5044) from VPC CIDR
   - Inbound: ICMP from VPC CIDR (troubleshooting)
   - Outbound: All traffic (for updates and log forwarding)
   - Purpose: Secure application hosting

### EC2 Instances

1. **Bastion Host**
   - Location: Public subnet with public IP
   - Purpose: SSH gateway and jump host
   - Access: Direct SSH from internet (restricted by CIDR)
   - Software: Amazon Linux 2 with SSH forwarding enabled

2. **Logstash Instance**
   - Location: Private subnet (no public IP)
   - Purpose: Log processing and analysis
   - Access: SSH via bastion host only
   - Software: Amazon Linux 2 with Java 11 and Docker pre-installed

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```hcl
module "compute" {
  source = "./modules/compute"
  
  # Networking inputs (from networking module)

## Connection Guide

### SSH to Bastion Host

```bash
# Use the output from ssh_connection_command
ssh -i ~/.ssh/your-key.pem ec2-user@<bastion-public-ip>
```

### SSH to Logstash Instance

```bash
# Method 1: Jump host (recommended)
ssh -i ~/.ssh/your-key.pem -J ec2-user@<bastion-public-ip> ec2-user@<logstash-private-ip>

# Method 2: SSH forwarding
ssh -i ~/.ssh/your-key.pem -L 2222:<logstash-private-ip>:22 ec2-user@<bastion-public-ip>
# Then in another terminal:
ssh -i ~/.ssh/your-key.pem -p 2222 ec2-user@localhost
```

## Log Forwarding Configuration

Configure your log shippers to send data to the Logstash endpoint:

```yaml
# Filebeat configuration example
output.logstash:
  hosts: ["<logstash-private-ip>:5044"]
```

```yaml
# Logstash input configuration
input {
  beats {
    port => 5044
  }
}
```

## Security Considerations

### Production Recommendations

1. **SSH Access**: Restrict `allowed_ssh_cidr` to specific IP ranges
2. **Key Management**: Use AWS Systems Manager Session Manager for keyless access
3. **Monitoring**: Enable VPC Flow Logs and CloudTrail
4. **Updates**: Implement automated patching for security updates

### Network Security

- Logstash instance has no direct internet access
- All traffic to Logstash must go through VPC routing
- Security groups implement least privilege access
- Bastion host acts as single point of entry

## Monitoring and Troubleshooting

### Health Checks

```bash
# Check bastion host connectivity
ping <bastion-public-ip>

# Check Logstash service from bastion
telnet <logstash-private-ip> 5044
```

### Log Analysis

```bash
# View Logstash logs (when running as service)
sudo journalctl -u logstash -f

# View system logs
sudo tail -f /var/log/messages
```

## Dependencies

- **Networking Module**: Must be deployed first to provide VPC and subnets
- **AWS Key Pair**: Must exist in the target region before deployment
- **AWS Provider**: Requires appropriate IAM permissions for EC2 and VPC

## Future Enhancements

- Auto Scaling Groups for high availability
- Application Load Balancer for Logstash clustering
- CloudWatch monitoring and alerting
- AWS Systems Manager integration
- EBS encryption and backup automation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **SSH Connection Failed**
   - Verify key pair exists and permissions (chmod 400)
   - Check security group rules and allowed_ssh_cidr
   - Confirm bastion host has public IP

2. **Cannot Reach Logstash**
   - Verify bastion host can reach private subnet
   - Check Logstash security group rules
   - Confirm Logstash service is running on port 5044

3. **Instance Launch Failed**
   - Verify key pair exists in the correct region
   - Check subnet has available IP addresses
   - Confirm IAM permissions for EC2 operations
